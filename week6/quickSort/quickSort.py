# In your Week 6 folder, download the file called ‘quick-sort.py’ for this assignment.
# Review the code so that you understand how the "Divide and Conquer" technique works.
# In this code, we utilized the first element of the list to be our pivot point.  This was just for convenience.  There are multiple of different methods for selecting a pivot point.
# Review the section "Deterministic Selection" in chapter 11 of your text book for another possible method.
# Search online for other pivot point methods for Quick Sort algorithm.
# Implement at least three alternatives besides selecting the first element as the pivot point.
# You may want to verify that your sorting code works first on a smaller list of numbers.
# Compare the times necessary to sort a random list of 1,000 elements and display their execution time.
# Did any particular method perform better?
